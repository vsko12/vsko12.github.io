Habits – those everyday actions we all have, or sometimes don't. It can take some time to realize how these seemingly small things can profoundly affect the course of our lives. These regular behaviors, whether we pay attention to them or not, have a remarkable ability to shape our futures, guide our choices, and play a pivotal role in our overall success or setbacks. Recognizing the transformative potential of habits and their undeniable role in our lives, we decided to go with three books, each with a unique perspective on the art and science of habit formation.

Our selection fell on "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey, and "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg was driven by the desire to explore the diverse aspects of habit-building approaches.

"Atomic Habits" by James Clear is a masterpiece, published in 2018, that draws upon the latest research in psychology and neuroscience to dissect the anatomy of habit formation. Clear takes us on a journey through the minutiae of daily behaviors, illustrating how tiny shifts can lead to remarkable transformations. This modern classic has garnered attention for its actionable insights and practical guidance on cultivating productive habits.

"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey, first published in 1989, has stood the test of time as a foundational text for personal and professional development. Covey's "7 Habits" framework offers a timeless approach to achieving effectiveness and balance in life. It provides a philosophical and strategic perspective on habit formation, rooted in principles and values.

"The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg, released in 2012, delves into the science of habit formation and the psychology of change. Duhigg takes us through gripping stories and scientific research to unveil the intricate mechanisms behind habits and their influence on our lives, both personally and in business settings.

These three books were chosen because they collectively offer a holistic exploration of habits — from the cutting-edge insights of "Atomic Habits" to the timeless wisdom of "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" and the scientific revelations in "The Power of Habit." Together, they provide a comprehensive understanding of how habits are formed, how they drive human behavior, and how they can be harnessed for personal and professional growth.

Before delving into the analysis, we had a foundational understanding of the subject of habits and their impact on personal and professional development. We were aware of the significance of habits in shaping daily routines, decision-making, and overall life outcomes due to the course “Healthy Habits" taken at NYUAD and self-exploration of the effect of our habits on our lives.

Our analysis will encompass word frequency, thematic exploration, and a review of each book, offering a nuanced understanding of the role habits play in shaping our future. 

We began our exploration with the creation of the word cloud for each book. The following words were the most frequent:

**1) “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey (1989):**
- people (629); win (441); life (383); time (351); principles (252)

![7 Habits Word Cloud](/assets/images/7_habits.png)
In Stephen R. Covey's work, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," the word "people" emerges as the most frequently used term. This choice of words underscores Covey's central focus on understanding and interacting effectively with individuals, both in personal and professional spheres. The word "win" follows closely, highlighting the book's emphasis on achieving success, not just in the traditional sense, but also in terms of personal growth and effectiveness. "Life" stands as another frequently recurring term, symbolizing a fundamental concept in Covey's philosophy. It reflects the book's exploration of how the habits we cultivate can profoundly impact the quality and direction of our lives. Furthermore, "time" and "principles" play significant roles, emphasizing the importance of managing time efficiently and building personal effectiveness on the foundation of timeless principles and values.

**2) “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg (2012):**
- new (341); people (311); time (258); like (228); started (187)

![Power of Habit Word Cloud](/assets/images/power_of_habit.png)
In Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit," the most frequently used word is "new." This term aligns with the book's exploration of how individuals can instill fresh habits and make positive changes in their lives. "People" appears as the second most common word, signifying the significance of understanding human behavior and social interactions within the context of habit formation. "Time" is another recurring theme, underlining how habits can lead to either time-saving or time-wasting behaviors. "Like" and "started" are also prominent, indicating the book's approachable and relatable style, allowing readers to connect with the subject matter and its focus on initiating positive changes.

**3) “Atomic Habits" by James Clear (2018):**
- behavior (246); make (233); time (198); like (192); change (177)

![Atomic Habits Word Cloud](/assets/images/atomic_habits.png)
James Clear's "Atomic Habits" showcases "behavior" as the most frequently used word, highlighting the core of the book's message: understanding and modifying one's behavior to cultivate better habits. "Make" follows closely, suggesting the proactive approach advocated by Clear, where individuals consciously create their own habits. Similar to the other books, "time" is a recurrent theme, emphasizing that effective habit formation can significantly impact how time is utilized. "Like" may indicate the idea of enjoying the habits we are trying to practice because otherwise, it might be very challenging to do so, while "change" underlines the book's core concept of personal growth and transformation through habit adjustment. 

Next, we decided to construct a relative frequencies graph to understand how the frequencies of 5 of the most common words compared across the texts.

![Relative Frequencies](/assets/images/relative_frequencies.png)
In examining the most frequent words in these three influential books about habits, a clear common thread emerges. The word "people" resonates throughout each text, being the most frequent in "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" underlining the fundamental importance of understanding human behavior, social interactions, and the role individuals play in the process of habit formation described in the book. Additionally, "time" is a recurring theme in all three books, but more so in “Atomic Habits”, signifying the universal recognition of the role of time management and the influence of habits in how we allocate our time in personal and professional development. "New" is more prominent in "The Power of Habit," perhaps highlighting themes of change and innovation. This visual representation allows for a quick comparative analysis, shedding light on the thematic priorities and focus areas of each book based on how often these key terms are mentioned.

To study word frequency in more detail, we decided to generate the word frequency graphs for our 3 texts.

![Word Frequencies](/assets/images/word_frequencies.png)
By mapping the prevalence of shared terms, we can discern thematic overlaps and unique emphases in each book. For instance, words like "habits," "change," and "behavior" are prominently positioned across all three texts, underscoring their common focus on the transformative power of habitual actions. The positioning of these keywords suggests they are central themes discussed at length in each book. However, specific terms like "family," "circle," and "boss" appear closer to "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," suggesting a more pronounced emphasis on interpersonal relationships and social spheres within that text. Meanwhile, "Atomic Habits" may uniquely emphasize "actions," implying a focus on individual accomplishment and the practical steps toward habit formation.

##### How our findings reinforce our past knowledge about habits
The findings from the textual analysis align very closely with our past knowledge of habits and ideas that we discussed in our class “Healthy Habits”. Words like “new” correlate with the theme of introducing new, small habits to spark significant life changes, as emphasized in “Atomic Habits”. The emphasis on "people" and "time" matches the focus on interpersonal leadership and time management as central tenets for effective habits. Similarly, The prominence of words like "habit" and "life" complements the exploration of the transformative power of habits in individuals' lives and within societal structures.

##### How well would this assignment work for a language other than English?
This assignment can be adapted to analyze texts in languages other than English since *Voyant Tools* has the corresponding instruments to do so. For example, the language of stop words can be adjusted according to the language of the text. However, the effectiveness of the analysis would depend on the number of suitable text analysis tools for the chosen language and the proficiency of the analyzer in that language. We did not face any limitations while working on this assignment since all the texts were originally published in English.
