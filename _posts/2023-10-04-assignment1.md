# Part 1
After experiencing browsing the museum website and the csv file, we realized that the website offers an intuitive and visually engaging user experience, with easy navigation and search features, as well as comprehensive metadata for each art piece, which is suitable for casual browsing and quick searches. The images of the art pieces were also present on the website, allowing for a detailed examination of the piece, which was one of the most attractive aspects of browsing. This visual element brought the art to life and allowed us to appreciate the details and nuances of each piece, enhancing our overall experience. The website's search functionality, which included filters by artist, time period, and medium, made it effortless to discover and explore art pieces based on specific criteria.

On the other hand, the csv file required more data manipulation and provided deeper data access, which was valuable for in-depth data analysis and research. To access data from the csv file, we had to utilize code commands to navigate through rows and columns of data, a process that could be overwhelming, especially for those less familiar with data management tools. However, this method allowed us to retrieve raw data that could potentially be used for various research purposes, such as statistical analysis or integration with other datasets. While the database lacked the visual appeal of the website, it excelled in offering a level of data granularity that we might find indispensable for more comprehensive projects.

One particular art piece of our interest was the one titled *[Orchids and Rocks](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/173594?position=173594)*, created by Yi Ha-ŭng, a royal prince and father of the last king of the Chosŏn dynasty. The metadata helped us understand that the artwork is a ten-panel folding screen made using ink on silk and is dated early autumn 1892. We found the composition of this screen to be very unique; although each panel can be seen as an individual painting, the ten panels are grouped in four pairs. After reading more about it, we understood that this composition provided a form of visual ambiguity that was appealing to Korean literati artists of the 19th and early 20th century, and with its large dimensions, we could guess that it was likely crafted for a royal palace.

We also found a print of *[The Bible](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/217881)* very interesting, particularly because during our initial exploration with the all objects CSV file, we tried looking for extinct cultures, which would eventually be the criteria for the selection of cultures for part 3. In doing so, we found that there were certain cultures that had very little representation in the Harvard Art Museum. This piece is one of the only seven pieces representing Yugoslav culture that went through several political changes and transformations over the years. It is an image made up of eight plates printed in black and white and five round plates printed in colors using etching with roulette and aquatint on paper technique.


# Part 2
For this part, we decided to focus on the Byzantine culture because we were interested in exploring cultures that are extinct. It also presents a captivating choice for our analysis since it has profound historical significance spanning over a millennium, diverse and evolving artistic traditions blending Eastern and Western influences, a pivotal role in the early spread of Christianity, and its enduring impact on the cultural heritage of the Eastern Mediterranean. Byzantine artifacts, often laden with religious and cultural significance, offer an opportunity to delve into how contemporary audiences engage with this rich legacy. We also realized that investigating viewing patterns can reveal shifting perceptions of Byzantine culture, shedding light on which aspects resonate most with today's audiences, and keeping alive the memory of a culture that has left an indelible mark on history.

For the Byzantine culture:

> Note: For the least viewed pieces we decided to keep more than 5 pieces on the list since most of them were coins with the same name but different characteristics.

Analyzing the most and least viewed items in the list, there are a few observations and speculations that we made regarding why certain items might be more popular than others.
The most viewed items in the Harvard Art Museums might be more popular because they offer diverse and intriguing content. Each piece, as here, a sculpture like the "Empress Bust Weight, Steelyard, and Collar with Chains" or a detailed artwork like the "Lamp or Censer with Scenes from the Life of Christ," has something unique to offer. These items attract a broad audience due to their variety, storytelling, and, in some cases, religious significance. For example, artifacts depicting scenes from Christian history draw those interested in religious art, while items linked to emperors and royalty appeal to those curious about history. The notable difference in viewer interest between these popular items and the least viewed ones prompts us to think about what captivates people when it comes to art and its narratives.

On the other hand, the least viewed items primarily consist of coins, many of which relate to the same ruler, Constans II. These coins might not be as popular because they seem repetitive and lack the visual appeal and storytelling found in the more viewed pieces. They don't offer varied narratives or depict significant scenes or figures, and some of them do not even have an image on the webpage, making them less appealing to a general audience. While every artifact has historical significance, the contrast in viewer engagement between the coins and the more diverse, visually engaging items highlights the role of visual appeal, diversity, and storytelling in attracting viewers to art.

For all objects belonging to the Byzantine culture, we were able to conduct an analysis using accession year data and a corresponding time series bar chart, shown below.

![Accession year time series bar graph](/assets/images/newplot.png)

The results obtained from this analysis were quite surprising for Byzantine culture. It became evident that the majority of the art pieces had been acquired during the same time period, specifically the 1950s. This prompted our curiosity to explore why this specific period was significant. Initial searches on Google did not yield satisfying answers. As we delved deeper into the individual pieces, we noticed an ***Acquisition and Rights*** category in their descriptions on the museum's website, particularly the line *Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Bequest of Thomas Whittemore*, which piqued our interest.

We discovered that in 1985, the Harvard Art Museums established a dedicated institution known as [The Arthur M. Sackler Museum](https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/history-and-the-three-museums), focusing on works from Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. Consequently, the Byzantine collection was relocated there after its inauguration. The mention of the *Bequest of Thomas Whittemore* indicated that the acquired pieces were, in fact, donations from an individual named Thomas Whittemore. In this context, 'bequest' refers to the act of gifting or donating items through a person's will, typically after their passing. It became evident that these pieces were associated with Thomas Whittemore.

Upon conducting more extensive research, we unearthed the historical context that clarified the mystery. [Thomas Whittemore](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/before-byzantium/who-was-thomas-whittemore) had founded the Byzantine Institute in 1930, an organization specialized in the study, restoration, and conservation of Byzantine art and architecture. He oversaw the Institute’s fieldwork projects and publication efforts until his sudden passing in 1950, precisely the year when Harvard Art Museums acquired most of the pieces, thereby establishing a compelling connection between the pieces, their donor, and their acquisition during this period.

# Part 3
In our third research phase, we chose to continue focusing on exploring cultures that no longer exist. Specifically, we decided to compare the Byzantine, Persian, and Ottoman cultures. In order to dig in, we decided to use **stop.words(‘english’)** as well as some additional stop words such as **nan**. The word clouds based on the combined descriptions and titles of the objects from these cultures are below.

![Byzantine Word Cloud](/assets/images/byzantine.png)

![Ottoman Word Cloud](/assets/images/ottoman.png)

![Persian Word Cloud](/assets/images/persian.png)

What particularly caught our attention was the surprising similarity in language between Ottoman and Persian cultures. Words like *manuscript*, *folio*, and *text* were shared between these two cultures. Furthermore, it was also interesting to see that the phrase *Persian texts* appeared in the Ottoman culture word cloud, highlighting their historical connections.

What stood out the most in our research was the consistent prominence of religion in all three cultures. We found words like *Cross*, *Prophet*, and *Qu’ran* recurring frequently. This emphasizes the significant role that religion played in shaping these societies, underlining its enduring influence on their values, traditions, and identities throughout history.
